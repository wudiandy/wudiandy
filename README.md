Having made a career shift from being a programmer. 
Exploring new paths in independent development. 
Admire simplicity and elegance, and a firm practitioner of minimalism. 
Sometimes as laid-back as a Buddhist, while at other times can be highly efficient. 
Constantly seeking a balance within these contradictions. 
Not only enjoy the peaceful solitude when alone but also love the lively and casual chatting with others.
